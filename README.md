# Mamography DL Project

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for mamography analysis, specifically for classifying radiogenomic TNBC (Triple-Negative Breast Cancer).

## Files:
- `app.py`: Main application file.
- `evaluate_model.py`: Script for evaluating the trained model.
- `radiogenomic_tnbc_transformer_classifier_1.keras`: The trained Keras model file (tracked by Git LFS).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
